    <abstract>

<t>This document describes the fundamental and unique style conventions
and editorial policies currently in use for the RFC Series.  It
captures the RFC Editor's basic requirements and offers guidance
regarding the style and structure of an RFC.  Additional guidance is
captured on a website that reflects the experimental nature of that
guidance and prepares it for future inclusion in the RFC Style Guide.
This document obsoletes RFC 7322, "RFC Style Guide".</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The ultimate goal of the RFC publication process is to produce
documents that are readable, clear, and consistent.  The basic formatting
conventions for RFCs were established
in the 1970s by the original RFC Editor, Jon Postel.  This document
describes the fundamental and unique style conventions and editorial
policies currently in use for the RFC Series <xref target="RFC4844"/> and is
intended as a stable, infrequently updated reference for authors,
editors, and reviewers.</t>

<t>The RFC Editor also maintains a web portion of the Style Guide (see
Appendix A.3) that describes issues as they are raised and indicates
how the RFC Editor intends to address them.  As new style issues
arise, the RFC Editor will first address them on the web portion of
the Style Guide <xref target="STYLE-WEB"/>.  These topics may become part of the RFC
Style Guide when it is revised.</t>

<t>The world of publishing has generally accepted rules for
grammar, punctuation, capitalization, sentence length and complexity, etc.
The RFC Editor generally follows these accepted
rules as defined by the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS) <xref target="CMOS"/>, with a
few important exceptions to avoid ambiguity in complex technical
prose and to handle mixtures of text and computer languages, or to
preserve historical formatting rules.  This document presents these
exceptions as applied or recommended by the RFC Editor.</t>

<t>All RFCs begin as Internet-Drafts (also referred to as I-Ds), and a
well-written and properly constructed Internet-Draft <xref target="ID-GUIDE"/>
provides a strong basis for a good RFC.  The RFC Editor accepts
Internet-Drafts from specified streams for publication [RFC4844] and
applies the rules and guidelines for the RFC Series during the
editorial process.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="rfc-editors-philosophy" title="RFC Editor's Philosophy">

<t>Authors may find it helpful to understand the RFC Editor's goals
during the publication process, namely to:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>Prepare the document according to RFC style and format.</t>
  <t>Make the document as clear, consistent, and readable as possible.</t>
  <t>Correct larger content/clarity issues; flag any unclear passages
for author review.</t>
  <t>Fix inconsistencies (e.g., terms that appear in various forms,
 inconsistent capitalization, discrepancies between a figure and the text that
 describes it).</t>
</list></t>

<t>We strive for consistency within:</t>

<t>a. the document,</t>

<t>b. a cluster of documents <xref target="CLUSTER"/>, and</t>

<t>c. the series of RFCs on the subject matter.</t>

<t>The editorial process of the RFC Editor is not an additional
technical review of the document.  Where the RFC Editor may suggest
changes in wording for clarity and readability, it is up to the
author, working group, or stream-approving body to determine whether
the changes have an impact on the technical meaning of the document
[RFC4844].  If the original wording is a more accurate representation
of the technical content being described in the document, it takes
precedence over editorial conventions.</t>

<t>The activity of editing sometimes creates a tension between author
and editor.  The RFC Editor attempts to minimize this conflict for
RFC publication while continually striving to produce a uniformly
excellent document series.  The RFC Editor refers to this fundamental
tension as "editorial balance,"" and maintaining this balance is a
continuing concern for the RFC Editor.  There is a prime directive
that must rule over grammatical conventions: do not change the
intended meaning of the text.</t>

<t>If the RFC Editor cannot edit a document without serious risk of
altering the meaning, it may be returned to the stream-approving body
for review.  See Appendix A.2 for more information.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="rfc-style-conventions" title="RFC Style Conventions">

<t>This Style Guide does not use terminology as defined in RFC 2119
<xref target="BCP14"/>.  In this document, lowercase use of "must" and "should"
indicates changes the RFC Editor will make automatically to conform
with this Style Guide versus those that may be questioned if not
applied.  The lowercase "must" indicates those changes that will be
applied automatically and are not at the discretion of the authors.
The lowercase "should" indicates the RFC Editor's recommended use,
but conformance with the recommendations is not required; the RFC
Editor may question whether the guidance may be applied.</t>

<section anchor="language" title="Language">

<t>The RFC publication language is English.  Spelling may be either
American or British, as long as an individual document is internally
consistent.  Where both American and British English spelling are
used within a document or cluster of documents, the text will be
modified to be consistent with American English spelling.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="punctuation" title="Punctuation">

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>A comma is used before the last item of a series, e.g.,  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
"TCP service is reliable, ordered, and full duplex"</t>
  <t>When quoting literal text, punctuation is placed outside quotation
marks, e.g.,  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Search for the string "Error Found".  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
When quoting general text, such as general text from another RFC,
punctuation may be included within the quotation marks, e.g.,  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
RFC 4844 indicates that "RFCs are available free of charge to
   anyone via the Internet. " <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Quotation marks are not necessary when text is formatted as a
block quotation.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="compounds" title="RFCs as Compounds">
  <t>Whenever possible:
  <list style='symbols'>
    <t>Hyphenated compounds formed with RFC numbers should be avoided;
      this can be accomplished by: rewording the sentence (e.g., [RFC5011]-style
      rollover –> rollover as described in RFC 5011). </t>
    <t>adding a note in either the Terminology or Conventions section mentioning
      the RFC so that other occurrences throughout the text will be understood by
      the reader to be in the style of said RFC (e.g., This document uses the term
      “rollover” as defined in RFC 5011.).</t>
    </list></t>
    <t>If use of an RFC number in attributive position is unavoidable, the
      preferred form should appear as in the example “RFC 5011-style rollover”.
      That is:
      <list style='symbols'>
        <t>no hyphen between “RFC” and the number (don’t use RFC-5011-style rollover)</t>
        <t>avoid hyphenating citations with text (don’t use [RFC5011]-style rollover)</t>
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>

</section>

<section anchor="dns-names-and-uris" title="DNS Names and URIs">

<t>DNS names, whether or not in URIs, that are used as generic examples
in RFCs should use the particular examples defined in "Reserved Top
Level DNS Names" <xref target="BCP32"/>, to avoid accidental conflicts.</t>

<t>Angle brackets are strongly recommended around URIs <xref target="STD66"/>, e.g.,</t>

<t>&lt;https://example.com/ &gt;</t>

<t>The use of HTTPS rather than HTTP is strongly encouraged.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="capitalization" title="Capitalization">

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>Capitalization must be consistent within the document and ideally
should be consistent with related RFCs.  Refer to the online table
of decisions on consistent usage of terms in RFCs <xref target="TERMS"/>.</t>
  <t>Per CMOS guidelines, the major words in RFC titles and section
titles should be capitalized (this is sometimes called "title
case").  Typically, all words in a title will be capitalized,
except for internal articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.</t>
  <t>Section titles that are in sentence form will follow typical
sentence capitalization.</t>
  <t>Titles of figures may be in sentence form or use title case.</t>
  <t>Some terms related to the various roles or parts of the streams authoring
    RFCs should be used consistently.  For example, when the term 'working group'
    or 'research group' is used as part of a
    specific group name, it will be capitalized (e.g., kitten Working Group,
    Crypto Forum Research Group). When used to generally refer to groups, it
    will be downcased.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section anchor="citations" title="Citations">

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>References and citations must match.  That is, there must be a
reference for each citation used, and vice versa.</t>
  <t>Citations must be enclosed in square brackets (e.g., "[CITE1]").</t>
  <t>Citations are restricted to ASCII-only characters.<xref target="RFC7997"/></t>
  <t>Citations must begin with a number or a letter, and may contain digits, letters,
  colons, hyphens, underscores, or dots.
    <list>
      <t>Example: "[IEEE.802.15.4]" rather than "[.802.15.4]"</t>
      <t>Example: "[RFC2119]" rather than "[RFC 2119]"</t>
    </list></t>
   <t>Citations may not include spaces, commas, quotation marks, or other punctuation (!, ?, etc.).
   <list>
   <t>Example: "See RFC 2119 <xref target="BCP14"/> for more information."</t>
 </list></t>
  <t>Cross-references within the body of the memo and to other RFCs
must use section numbers rather than page numbers, as pagination
may change per format and device.</t>
  <t>An citation may a) follow the subject for which it is being cited
    or b) be read as part of the text. For example:
    <list>
    <t>a) As part of the transition to IPv6, NAT64 [RFC6146] and DNS64
     [RFC6147] technologies will be utilized by some access networks to
     provide IPv4 connectivity for IPv6-only nodes [RFC6144].</t>
   </list></t>
 </list></t>

    <t>or
      <list>

      <t>b) Note that SAVI raises a number of important privacy considerations
       that are discussed more fully in [RFC6959].</t>
     </list></t>

<t>We recommend using a) and strongly recommend consistent use of one style throughout.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="abbreviation-rules" title="Abbreviation Rules">

<t>Abbreviations should be expanded in document titles and upon first
use in the document.  The full expansion of the text should be
followed by the abbreviation itself in parentheses.  The exception is
an abbreviation that is so common that the readership of RFCs can be
expected to recognize it immediately; examples include (but are not
limited to) TCP, IP, SNMP, and HTTP.  The online list of
abbreviations <xref target="ABBR"/> provides guidance.  Some cases are marginal, and
the RFC Editor will make the final judgment, weighing obscurity
against complexity.</t>

<t>Note: The online list of abbreviations is not exhaustive or
   definitive.  It is a list of abbreviations appearing in RFCs and
   sometimes reflects discussions with authors, Working Group Chairs,
   and/or Area Directors (ADs).  Note that some abbreviations have
   multiple expansions.  Additionally, this list includes some terms
   that look like abbreviations but that are actually fixed names for
   things and hence cannot and should not be expanded.  These are
   noted as "No Expansion".</t>

</section>



  <section anchor="images" title="Images and Figures">
  <t>The goal of having images within an RFC is to convey information. A good
    diagram or image expresses information quickly, clearly, and with low chance
    of misunderstanding. Technically correct but confusing images get in the
    way of understanding and implementation.</t>
    <t><list style='symbols'>
      <t>Images should be legible when displayed on a standard screen (1920x1080)
        and printable on either A4 or US Letter paper. Any text within the diagram
        should be readable at that resolution. </t>
      <t>Authors should use black on white, not white on black. No color or
        greyscale <xref target="RFC7990"/><xref target="RFC7996"/></t>
      <t>Keep your diagrams as simple as possible. If an object in the diagram
        is not immediately relevant, leave it out. If you have several ideas you
        want to convey, consider using more than one diagram.</t>
      <t>San-serif fonts are generally considered more readable for digital
        material. [citation needed]</t>
      <t>The style of diagrams within an RFC should be consistent both within a
        single RFC and within a cluster of RFCs (fonts, shapes,
        lines). For example, if you you use a dashed line to indicate a certain
        type of packet flow, then continue to use that style of line consistently.
        </t>
      <t>Line styles, including thickness, color, and arrow types, are easy
        methods to convey a particular meaning to the reader. Consistently use
        the same line styles to convey a particular meaning throughout all
        diagrams within an RFC in order to avoid confusing the reader.</t>
      <t>Flowcharts: avoid crossing the lines if possible.</t>
    </list></t>

<section anchor="structure-of-an-rfc" title="Structure of an RFC">

<t>A published RFC will largely contain the elements in the following
list.  Some of these sections are required, as noted.  Those sections
marked with "*" will be supplied by the RFC Editor during the
editorial process when necessary. The rules for each of these elements are
described in more detail below.

<t>Within the body of the memo, the order shown above is strongly
recommended.  Exceptions may be questioned.  Outside the body of the
memo, the order above is required.  The section numbers above are for
illustrative purposes; they are not intended to correspond to
required numbering in an RFC.</t>

<t>The elements preceding the body of the memo should not be numbered.
Typically, the body of the memo will have numbered sections and the
appendices will be labeled with letters.  Any sections that appear
after the appendices should not be numbered or labeled (e.g., see
"Contributors" above).</t>

<section anchor="first-page-header" title="First-Page Header">

<t>Headers will follow the format described in "RFC Streams, Headers,
and Boilerplates" <xref target="RFC7841"/> and its successors.  In addition, the
following conventions will apply.</t>

<section anchor="authoreditor" title="Author/Editor">

<t>The final determination of who should be listed as an author or editor on
an RFC is made by the stream, as is whether or not including author
affiliation is required.</t>

<t>The author's name (initial followed by family name) appears on the
first line of the heading.  Some variation, such as additional
initials or capitalization of family name, is acceptable.  Once the
author has selected how their name should appear, they should use
that display consistently in all of their documents.</t>

<t>The total number of authors or editors on the first page is generally
limited to five individuals and their affiliations.  If there is a
request for more than five authors, the stream-approving body needs
to consider if one or two editors should have primary responsibility
for this document, with the other individuals listed in the
Contributors or Acknowledgements section.  There must be a direct
correlation of authors and editors in the document header and the
Authors' Addresses section.  These are the individuals that must sign
off on the document during the AUTH48 process and respond to
inquiries, such as errata.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="organization" title="Organization">

<t>The author's organization is indicated on the line following the
author's name.</t>

<t>For multiple authors, each author name appears on its own line,
followed by that author's organization.  When more than one author is
affiliated with the same organization, the organization can be
"factored out," appearing only once following the corresponding
Author lines.  However, such factoring is inappropriate when it would
force an unacceptable reordering of author names.</t>

<t>If an author cannot or will not provide an affiliation for any
reason, "Independent", "Individual Contributor", "Retired", or some
other term that appropriately describes the author's affiliation may
be used.  Alternatively, a blank line may be included in the document
header when no affiliation is provided.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="issn-2070-1721" title="ISSN: 2070-1721">

<t>The RFC Series has been assigned an International Standard Serial
Number of 2070-1721 <xref target="ISO3297"/>.  It will be included by the
RFC Editor.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="updates-and-obsoletes" title="Updates and Obsoletes">

<t>When an RFC obsoletes or updates a previously published RFC or RFCs,
this information is included in the document header.  For example:</t>

<t>"Updates: nnnn" or "Updates: nnnn, ..., nnnn"</t>

<t>"Obsoletes: nnnn" or "Obsoletes: nnnn, ..., nnnn"</t>

<t>If the document updates or obsoletes more than one document, numbers
will be listed in ascending order.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="full-title" title="Document Title">

<t>The title must be centered below the rest of the heading, preceded by
two blank lines and followed by one blank line.</t>

<t>Choosing a good title for an RFC can be a challenge.  A good title
should fairly represent the scope and purpose of the document without
being either too general or too specific and lengthy.</t>

<t>Abbreviations in a title must generally be expanded when first
encountered (see Section 3.6 for additional guidance on
abbreviations).</t>

<t>It is often helpful to follow the expansion with the parenthesized
abbreviation, as in the following example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
                  Encoding Rules for the
  Common Routing Encapsulation Extension Protocol (CREEP)
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The RFC Editor recommends that documents describing a particular
company's private protocol should bear a title of the form "Foo's ...
Protocol" (where Foo is a company name), to clearly differentiate it
from a protocol of more general applicability.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="abstract-section" title="Abstract Section">

<t>Every RFC must have an Abstract that provides a concise and
comprehensive overview of the purpose and contents of the entire
document, to give a technically knowledgeable reader a general
overview of the function of the document.</t>

<t>Composing a useful Abstract generally requires thought and care.
Usually, an Abstract should begin with a phrase like "This memo ..."
or "This document ..."  A satisfactory Abstract can often be
constructed in part from material within the Introduction section,
but an effective Abstract may be shorter, less detailed, and perhaps
broader in scope than the Introduction.  Simply copying and pasting
the first few paragraphs of the Introduction is allowed, but it may
result in an Abstract that is both incomplete and redundant.  Note
also that an Abstract is not a substitute for an Introduction; the
RFC should be self-contained as if there were no Abstract.</t>

<t>Similarly, the Abstract should be complete in itself.  It will appear
in isolation in publication announcements and in the online index of
RFCs.  Therefore, the Abstract must not contain citations.</t>

<t>If the RFC updates or obsoletes an earlier RFC, that should be mentioned in
  the abstract as well.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rfc-editor-or-stream-notes-section" title="RFC Editor or Stream Notes Section">

<t>A stream-approving body may approve the inclusion of an editorial
note to explain anything unusual about the process that led to the
document's publication or to note a correction.  In this case, a
stream note section will contain such a note.</t>

<t>Additionally, an RFC Editor Note section may contain a note inserted
by the RFC Editor to highlight special circumstances surrounding
an RFC.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="status-of-this-memo-section" title="Status of This Memo Section">

<t>The RFC Editor will supply an appropriate "Status of This Memo" as
defined in RFC  [RFC7841] and "Format for RFCs in the IAB Stream"
<xref target="IAB-FORM"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="copyright-licenses-and-ipr-boilerplate-section" title="Copyright, Licenses, and IPR Boilerplate Section">

<t>The full copyright and license notices are available on the IETF
Trust Legal Provisions documents website <xref target="IETF-TRUST"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="table-of-contents-section" title="Table of Contents Section">

<t>A Table of Contents (TOC) is required in all RFCs.  It must be
positioned after the Copyright Notice and before the Introduction.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="body-of-the-memo" title="Body of the Memo">

<t>Following the TOC is the body of the memo.</t>

<t>Each RFC must include an Introduction section that (among other
things) explains the motivation for the RFC and (if appropriate)
describes the applicability of the document, e.g., whether it
specifies a protocol, provides a discussion of some problem, is
simply of interest to the Internet community, or provides a status
report on some activity.  The body of the memo and the Abstract must
be self-contained and separable.  This may result in some duplication
of text between the Abstract and the Introduction; this is
acceptable.</t>

<section anchor="introduction-section" title="Introduction Section">

<t>The Introduction section should always be the first section following
the TOC (except in the case of MIB module documents).  While
"Introduction" is recommended, authors may choose alternate titles
such as "Overview" or "Background".  These alternates are acceptable.</t>

<t>For MIB module documents, common practice has been for "The
Internet-Standard Management Framework" <xref target="MIB-BOILER"/> text to appear
as Section 1.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="requirements-language-section" title="Requirements Language Section">

<t>Some documents use certain capitalized words ("MUST", "SHOULD", etc.)
to specify precise requirement levels for technical features.
RFC 2119 <xref target="BCP14"/> defines a default interpretation of these
capitalized words in IETF documents.  If this interpretation is used,
RFC 2119 must be cited (as specified in RFC 2119) and included as a
normative reference.  Otherwise, the correct interpretation must be
specified in the document.</t>

<t>This section must appear as part of the body of the memo (as defined
by this document).  It must appear as part of, or subsequent to, the
Introduction section.</t>

<t>These words are considered part of the technical content of the
document and are intended to provide guidance to implementers about
specific technical features, generally governed by considerations of
interoperability.  RFC 2119 says:</t>

<t>Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with
   care and sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used where
   it is actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior
   which has potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting
   retransmisssions)  For example, they must not be used to try to
   impose a particular method on implementers where the method is not
   required for interoperability.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iana-considerations-section" title="IANA Considerations Section">

<t>For guidance on how to register IANA-related values or create new
registries to be managed by IANA, see "Guidelines for Writing an IANA
Considerations Section in RFCs" <xref target="BCP26"/>.</t>

<t>The RFC Editor will update text accordingly after the IANA
assignments have been made.  It is helpful for authors to clearly
identify where text should be updated to reflect the newly assigned
values.  For example, the use of "TBD1", "TBD2", etc., is recommended
in the IANA Considerations section and in the body of the memo.</t>

<t>If the authors have provided values to be assigned by IANA, the
RFC Editor will verify that the values inserted by the authors match
those that have actually been registered on the IANA site.  When
writing a given value, consistent use of decimal or hexadecimal is
recommended.</t>

<t>If any of the IANA-related information is not clear, the RFC Editor
will work with IANA to send queries to the authors to ensure that
assignments and values are properly inserted.</t>


</section>
<section anchor="internationalization-considerations-section" title="Internationalization Considerations Section">

<t>All RFCs that deal with internationalization issues should have a
section describing those issues; see "IETF Policy on Character Sets
and Languages" <xref target="BCP18"/>, Section 6, for more information.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations-section" title="Security Considerations Section">

<t>All RFCs must contain a section that discusses the security
considerations relevant to the specification; see "Guidelines for
Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations" <xref target="BCP72"/> for more
information.</t>

<t>Note that additional boilerplate material for RFCs containing MIB and
YANG modules also exists.  See "Security Guidelines for IETF MIB
Modules" <xref target="MIB-SEC"/> and "yang module security considerations"
<xref target="YANG-SEC"/> for details.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="references-section" title="References Section">

<t>The reference list is solely for recording reference entries.
Introductory text is not allowed.</t>

<t>The RFC style allows the use of any of a variety of reference styles,
as long as they are used consistently within a document.  However,
where necessary, some reference styles have been described for use
within the Series.  See the examples in this document.</t>

<t>The RFC Editor ensures that references to other RFCs refer to the
most current RFC available on that topic (unless provided with a
reason not to do so).  When referring to an obsoleted document, it is
common practice to also refer to the most recent version.</t>

<t>A reference to an RFC that has been assigned an STD <xref target="RFC1311"/>, BCP
<xref target="RFC1818"/>, or FYI <xref target="FYI90"/> sub-series number must include the
sub-series number of the document.  Note that the FYI series was
ended by RFC 6360.  RFCs that were published with an FYI sub-series
number and still maintain the FYI number must include the sub-series
number in the reference.</t>

<t>Reference lists must indicate whether each reference is normative or
informative, where normative references are essential to implementing
or understanding the content of the RFC and informative references
provide additional information.  More information about normative and
informative references may be found in the IESG's statement
"Normative and Informative References" <xref target="REFS"/>.  When both normative
and informative references exist, the references section should be
split into two subsections:</t>

<t>Templates are available on the RFC Editor website for the XML format of
  certain references <xref target="REFEXAMPLE"/>.</t>

<t>s.  References</t>

<t>s.1.  Normative References</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
        xxx
        ...
        xxx

<t>s.2.  Informative References</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
        xxx
        ...
        xxx
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>References will generally appear in alphanumeric order by citation
tag.  Where there are only normative or informative references, no
subsection is required; the top-level section should say "Normative
References" or "Informative References".</t>

<t>Normative references to Internet-Drafts will cause publication of the
RFC to be suspended until the referenced draft is also ready for
publication; the RFC Editor will then update the entry to refer to
the RFC and publish both documents simultaneously.</t>

<section anchor="uris-in-rfcs" title="URIs in RFCs">

<t>The use of URIs in references is acceptable, as long as the URI is
the most stable (i.e., unlikely to change and expected to be
continuously available) and direct reference possible.  The URI will
be verified as valid during the RFC editorial process.</t>

<t>If a dated URI (one that includes a timestamp for the page) is
available for a referenced web page, its use is required.</t>

<t>Note that URIs may not be the sole information provided for a
reference entry.</t>

<t>The use of HTTPS rather than HTTP is strongly encouraged.</t>


</section>
<section anchor="referencing-rfcs" title="Referencing RFCs">

<t>The following format is required for referencing RFCs. The Stream
  abbreviation should be used; when no stream is available, as with legacy RFCs,
  this may be left blank. </t>
<t>Note the ordering for multiple authors: the format of

<section anchor="referencing-stds-and-bcps" title="Referencing STDs and BCPs">

<t>Internet Standards (STDs) and Best Current Practices (BCPs) may
consist of a single RFC or multiple RFCs.  When an STD or BCP that
contains multiple RFCs is referenced, the reference entry should
include ALL of the RFCs comprising that sub-series.  The authors
should refer to specific RFC numbers as part of the text (not as
citations) and cite the sub-series number.  Inclusion of the URI to
the STD or BCP info page is recommended.  The text should appear as follows:</t>

<section anchor="app-A" title="Related Procedures">

<t>The following procedures are related to the application and updating
   of the RFC Style Guide.</t>

<section anchor="app-a1" title="Dispute Resolution">

<t>There are competing rationales for some of the rules described in
   this Guide, and the RFC Editor has selected the ones that work best
   for the Series.  However, at times, an author may have a disagreement
   with the RFC Production Center (RPC) over the application of Style
   Guide conventions.  In such cases, the authors should discuss their
   concerns with the RPC.  If no agreement can be reached between the
   RPC and the authors, the RFC Series Editor will, with input from the
   appropriate stream-approving body, make a final determination.  If
   further resolution is required, the dispute resolution process as
   described in the RFC Editor Model <xref target ="RFC6635"/> will be followed.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="app-a2"  title="Returning an I-D to the Document Stream">

<t>For a given document, if the RFC Editor determines that it cannot be
   edited without serious risk of altering the meaning of the technical
   content or if the RFC Editor does not have the resources to provide
   the level of editing it needs, it may be sent back to the stream-
   approving body with a request to improve the clarity, consistency,
   and/or readability of the document.  This is not to be considered a
   dispute with the author.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="app-a3"  title="Revising This Document and Associated Web Pages">

<t>The RFC Series is continually evolving as a document series.  This
   document focuses on the fundamental and stable requirements that must
   be met by an RFC.  From time to time, the RFC Editor may offer less
   formal recommendations that authors may apply at their discretion;
   these recommendations may be found on the RFC Editor website
   "Guidelines for RFC Style" <xref target="STYLE-WEB"/>.</t>

<t>When a new recommendation is made regarding the overall structure and
   formatting of RFCs, it will be published on that page and accepted
   for a period of time before the RFC Editor determines whether it
   should become part of the fundamental requirements in the RFC Style
   Guide or remain as a less formal recommendation.  That period of time
   will vary, in part depending on the frequency with which authors
   encounter and apply the guidance.</t>
